# rubyMooc
some assumptions for this project plus the required once:
-  the instructor can edit and delete only his own courses and lectures 
- avatar image is not mandatory it has a default one 
- avatar image in edit profiles 
- attachment is not mandatory 
- a student can't crud on courses or lectures 
- users can like and dislike and report lecture as spam 



note before start the site preview:
##  please run the seed first before start the site.
seeds contains data not only admin user. 



# the test:: 
I have made a test for lecture model and controller with 4 different cases plus the default once 

users :
instructor user: hager@gmail.com 
password: hagerh
student user: ali@gmail.com
password: hagerh

you can make another user but those for examples only .
