some assumptions for this project plus the required once:
-  the instructor can edit and delete only his own courses and lectures 
- avatar image is not mandatory it has a default one 
- avatar image in edit profiles 
- avatar image accept only images of kind (jpg jpeg gif png)
- attachment is not mandatory 
- attachment accept files only from kind of (pdf doc htm html docx zip rar txt)
- a student can't crud on courses or lectures 
- users can like and dislike and report lecture as spam 



note before start the site preview:
##  please run the seed first before start the site.
seeds contain data not only admin user. 
(I use seed dump gem for that so you may drop and create new database and add the content via seed ).



# the test:: 
I have made a test for lecture model and controller with 4 different cases plus the default once 

users :
instructor user: hager@gmail.com 
password: hagerh
student user: ali@gmail.com
password: hagerh

you can make another user but those for examples only .
